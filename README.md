# BotDetector

In BotDetector, we propose a new method for the detection of malicious social bots on Twitter using Artificial Immune System based on the Dendritic Cell algorithm.

BotDetector can check either individual accounts or multiple user accounts that posted tweets containing queried keywords.

BotDetector allows users to check not only if an account is a bot, but also its intentions. This makes it possible, for example, to detect malicious bots.
